## Overview

This project is part of the Master's Program in Computer Science (Field of Study: Intelligent Systems) at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, Winter Semester 2025/2026, supervised by Prof. Dr. Christian Baun.

We are developing an AI-powered FPV drone system focused on **structural inspection and monitoring applications**, utilizing computer vision and machine learning to automate infrastructure assessment.

## Project Goals

- Develop and integrate AI applications for structural inspection
- Implement object detection and defect recognition systems
- Research and integrate autopilot capabilities
- Create delivery/payload mechanisms for inspection equipment
- Build comprehensive documentation for replication and education

## Hardware Components

- FPV Drone Frame with Flight Controller
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 WH (Single-board computer)
- Google Coral USB Accelerator (AI inference)
- GPS Receiver
- Camera System
- FPV Transmitter and Goggles
- ELRS Receiver
- Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC)
- Motors and Batteries

## Software Stack

- **Flight Controller Firmware**: Betaflight / INAV / ArduPilot
- **Ground Control Station**: QGroundControl
- **Operating System**: Raspbian / Ubuntu
- **AI Framework**: TensorFlow Lite, YOLO
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Hardware & Software Familiarization
Understanding the capabilities and limitations of all drone components.

### Task 2: AI Application Development
Focus on structural inspection applications including:
- Crack detection in buildings and bridges
- Surface defect identification
- Thermal anomaly detection
- Real-time object recognition

### Task 3: Autopilot Integration
Implementing autonomous flight capabilities using INAV or ArduPilot.

### Task 4: Delivery/Payload System
Developing drop mechanisms for delivering inspection equipment.

### Task 5: Documentation & Presentation
Creating comprehensive online documentation via GitHub Pages.
