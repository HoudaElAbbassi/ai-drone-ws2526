# Road Damage Detection - Project Overview

[← Back to Home](../)

## Mission Statement

Our AI-powered drone system revolutionizes road infrastructure maintenance by providing automated, efficient, and accurate road damage detection. By flying over roads and analyzing surface conditions in real-time, we enable proactive maintenance and improve road safety.

## The Problem

Traditional road inspection methods face several challenges:

- **Time-consuming**: Manual inspections require significant labor and time
- **Costly**: Professional inspectors and specialized equipment are expensive
- **Inconsistent**: Human assessment can vary between inspectors
- **Dangerous**: Inspectors must work near traffic or on damaged roads
- **Reactive**: Damage often discovered after it becomes severe
- **Limited coverage**: Budget constraints limit inspection frequency

## Our Solution

An autonomous drone equipped with:

1. **High-resolution camera** for detailed surface imaging
2. **AI-powered detection** using deep learning models
3. **GPS tracking** for precise damage localization
4. **Real-time processing** using edge computing (Google Coral)
5. **Automated reporting** with damage classification and severity

## Types of Road Damage Detected

### 1. Longitudinal Cracks
**Description**: Cracks running parallel to the road centerline, typically in the direction of traffic flow.

**Causes**:
- Poor joint construction
- Shrinkage of pavement surface
- Poorly constructed paving lane joints

**Severity levels**:
- Low: Width < 6mm
- Medium: Width 6-19mm
- High: Width > 19mm

### 2. Transverse Cracks
**Description**: Cracks running perpendicular to the road centerline, across the traffic direction.

**Causes**:
- Thermal expansion and contraction
- Hardening of asphalt
- Reflection from underlying layers

**Severity levels**:
- Low: Width < 6mm, minimal branching
- Medium: Width 6-19mm, some branching
- High: Width > 19mm, extensive branching

### 3. Alligator (Fatigue) Cracking
**Description**: Interconnected cracks forming patterns resembling alligator skin or chicken wire.

**Causes**:
- Structural failure
- Excessive loading
- Weak subgrade or base
- Thin pavement

**Severity levels**:
- Low: Fine cracks, no loss of material
- Medium: Interconnected cracks, slight raveling
- High: Severe interconnection, significant material loss

### 4. Potholes
**Description**: Bowl-shaped depressions in the pavement surface, varying in size and depth.

**Causes**:
- Water infiltration through cracks
- Freeze-thaw cycles
- Traffic loading on weakened pavement

**Severity levels**:
- Low: Diameter < 200mm, depth < 25mm
- Medium: Diameter 200-500mm, depth 25-50mm
- High: Diameter > 500mm, depth > 50mm

### 5. Rutting
**Description**: Longitudinal depressions in the wheel paths, where repeated traffic has compressed the pavement.

**Causes**:
- Consolidation or lateral movement of materials
- Inadequate compaction
- Weak surface mix

**Severity levels**:
- Low: Depth < 13mm
- Medium: Depth 13-25mm
- High: Depth > 25mm

### 6. Bleeding
**Description**: Film of asphalt binder on the pavement surface, creating a shiny, glass-like appearance.

**Causes**:
- Excess asphalt in mixture
- Low air void content
- Hot weather

**Severity levels**:
- Low: Slight bleeding, surface still rough
- Medium: Moderate bleeding, becoming slippery
- High: Severe bleeding, very slippery surface

### 7. Weathering
**Description**: Loss of surface aggregate and binder, resulting in rough, pitted surface.

**Causes**:
- Aging of asphalt
- Traffic wear
- Environmental factors (UV, rain, temperature)

**Severity levels**:
- Low: Aggregate slightly exposed
- Medium: Significant aggregate loss
- High: Severe raveling, base layer exposed
